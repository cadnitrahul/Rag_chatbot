# RAG Chatbot

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot** that combines a **vector database retriever** with a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to answer user queries more accurately. Instead of relying only on the LLMâ€™s pre-trained knowledge, it retrieves relevant context from external data sources and generates grounded, context-aware responses.

## Features
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline (retriever + generator).
- Uses embeddings to store and retrieve documents efficiently.
- Integrates with LLMs to generate natural, human-like responses.
- Modular design for easy integration with different datasets or vector stores.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **LangChain** for RAG pipeline
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for embeddings / LLM
- **Vector Database** (Weaviate / FAISS / Chroma, depending on config)
- **Streamlit / CLI** for interface (customizable)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd rag_chatbot
   ```
2. Create & activate virtual environment
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
   env\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the chatbot
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Usage
```
User: What is RAG in NLP?
Bot: RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It combines information retrieval with language generation to provide more factual and grounded responses.
```

## Future Improvements
- Add support for PDF/website ingestion.
- Enhance retriever with semantic search & filtering.
- Deploy as a web app with Streamlit/FastAPI.
